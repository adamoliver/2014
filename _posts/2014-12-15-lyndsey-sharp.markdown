On the 25th of January Lyndsey Sharp was finally presented with her European Gold Medal after being denied the European Championships 800 metres title in Helsinki. Russian athlete Yelena Arzhakova was stripped of the title after being found guilty of doping.

The medal was presented at the Emirates Arena in front of a capacity 5,000 crowd.
